This is an simple example of a proxy server, to set this up, simply open this in an codespace, make two different terminals, for one do the code
'node proxy.js'

make another terminal, and run 

'node browser.js'

BTW this is a work in progress. So dont cry to me, this bypasses the payment API which is basically a firewall that is used to stop the server from connecting to the browser.
